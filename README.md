Exploring Seattle's public bike traffic data

Check it out! https://github.com/mrogove/SeattleBikes2/blob/master/seattleAnalyses.ipynb

A follow-up to the mrogove.github.io/SeattleBikes exploration. 
Looking at other ways to analyze this and similar count data elsewhere around the city.

Source for all data:

## Qs:
Q: What is this?
A: This was for an interview challenge. The purpose was to demonstrate how to handle data from different sources for different downstream audiences.

Q: Why have all these separate notebooks?
A: To demonstrate that, while these CSVs come from the same source, that's not always the case. It was for the context of the presentation, as a stand-in for data pipelines from different sources.
